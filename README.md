# Mathematical-Series-Generator
Python Project
This is a Python Project to generate mathematical series such as 
1. ABUNDANT NUMBERS
2. ARMSTRONG NUMBERS
3. COMPOSITE NUMBERS
4. DEFICIENT NUMBERS
5. EVEN NUMBERS
6. FIBONACCI NUMBERS
7. HARSHAD/NIVEN NUMBERS
8. ODD NUMBERS
9. PERFECT NUMBERS
10. PERFECT SQUARES
11. PRIME NUMBERS
12. WIEFERICH PRIME NUMBERS

Also we can check whether a given number belongs to a particular series.
If you want to know more details about a number series program has an option called know more which can navigate the execution to a web page containing the details of the number.
